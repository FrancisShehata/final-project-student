# Internet Student Recruitment System
Champlain Final Project II ECP | ISRS	

### Project Desription 

ISRS short for Internet Student Recruitment System is a project created by the student of Champlain College in the scope of their Final Project. 

ISRS is a student repository created with a python/flask back end and a React JS front end.that will allow employers to view potential employees. Recent graduate have found it hard to find jobs so the ISRS will potentially help them spread their information out to the employers which will have access to their information. Due to legal reason, we do not have access to real students. We are creating FAKE/MOCK data just for the sake of the project. 

This project is being done with the aid of mentor and external client Dr. Ben Hamza, a professor from Concordia University that had the kindness to oversee this project. 

### Project Structure

- Every developper will have their own specific tag so it is easier to read the branches they have been working on 
- The acronym should be the first letter of your name and the last (VS,FS,AS,FL)

-You should also be adding the story number depending on the JIRA story you are taking on. 

- Branches will be named with the following convention depending on what they are working:

	-feat/
	
	-bug/
	
	-doc/
	
	-conf/

- A branch should look like this
```
git checkout -b feat/VS-ISRS-6_Create_Student_For_Admin
```

### Pull Request Naming (PR)

-To document PRs easily we will adhere to the following standard: 

```
feat(INITIAL-JiraStoryID): short description
```
- In inittial you would put your inittials 

- Keep the parantheses
